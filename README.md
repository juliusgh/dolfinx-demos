# Some DOLFINx demos and resources

This repository contains some demos and resources for the Finite Element software [DOLFINx](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx), which is part of [FEniCSx](https://github.com/FEniCS).

The material has been created in the scope of the course [Simulation Software Engineering](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering) at the University of Stuttgart.

## Demos

### Python demos

- [Solve the Poisson equation using a matrix-free CG solver](python/demo_poisson_matrix_free.ipynb)
- [Solve the Stokes equations using various stable pairs of Finite Elements](python/demo_stokes_stable_pairs.ipynb)
- [Solve the biharmonic equation using a discontinuous Galerkin method](python/demo_biharmonic.ipynb)

### C++ demos

- [Solve the biharmonic equation using a discontinuous Galerkin method](python/demo_biharmonic.ipynb)

## Other resources

- [DOLFIN to DOLFINx cheatsheet](dolfin-dolfinx-cheatsheet.md): Could be helpful for the transitioning from legacy DOLFIN/FEniCS to the new DOLFINx/FEniCSx
- [Report for the course Simulation Software Engineering](report): Contains a very compact overview about the FEniCS(x) software
